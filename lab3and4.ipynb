    "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Data](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/esg/) project. The ESG data reports data from every country in the world over the time frame from 1960-2021 on a wide variety of topics including education, health, and economic factors within the countries. Second, we will use data on the quality and democratic character of countries' governments as reported by the [Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)](https://www.v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/) project at the University of Notre Dame. By using both data sources, we can conduct analyses to see whether democratic openness leads to better societal outcomes for countries. We can also write SQL queries to capture a wide range of information on countries' political parties, tax systems, and banking industries, for example. Or as Cardi B would say, \"You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee. I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me.\"\n",

    "Our goals are to download the data and load them into our Python environment, to use `pandas` to clean the data and merge corresponding datasets, to confirm that the tables comprise a 3rd normal form relational database, to load the dataframes as entities in a PostgreSQL database, to construct an ER diagram for the database, and to write several SQL queries for the database.

    "k. Here's where a deep understanding of the data becomes very important. There are two reasons why an observation may fail to match in a merge. One reason is a difference in spelling. Suppose that South Korea (which is also known as the Republic of Korea) is coded as SKO in the World Bank data and ROK in V-Dem. In this case, we should recode one or the other of SKO and ROK so that they match, otherwise we will lose the data on South Korea. But the second reason why observations might fail to match is due to differences in coverage in the data collection strategy: it is possible that a country wasn't included in one data's coverage, or that certain years for that country were not included. For differences in coverage, there's no way to manipulate the data to match, so we are out of luck and we have to either delete these observations or proceed with missing data from one of the data sources.\n",
